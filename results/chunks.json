The Makro stores potentially affected are Belfast, Charlton, Ipswich, Reading, Bristol, Enfield, Norwich, Sheffield, Cardiff, Fareham, Rayleigh; other stores may, in the future, be affected, in which case the details contained within this Joint Statement will apply. The Company presented the business case for the change, having reviewed the cost, profitability, and efficiencies of running the Coffee Shops. It was proposed that its customers would be best served by transferring the management of these areas to catering customers with specialist knowledge and experience of running similar businesses, enabling the Company to focus on providing great choice, price, and service in all other areas of the Store. This business case was accepted by the subgroup. ",

There are two main types of devices: inward facing and external facing cameras. The inward facing vehicle camera system is designed to capture video footage and audio where an event has been detected or manually triggered (e.g., when activated by a G-force trigger such as hard braking, sudden acceleration, swerving, excessive speed, or other potentially unsafe actions that could lead to a collision). Some systems use telematics observation through a R watch to warn the driver of unsafe actions. The driver can also trigger the camera manually if they have a potential immediate concern for their safety. External facing vehicle cameras are similar to CCTV but are fixed onto the external body of the vehicle; this includes in some instances the use of 360-degree cameras that aid a driver by allowing full view of the surrounding environment to help prevent accidents and improve driver safety. Vehicle cameras have several uses including protecting the personal safety and security of our colleagues and members of the public, preventing against crime and protecting vehicles from damage, disruption, vandalism, and or any other crime, assisting in accident investigations, assisting in the identification of dangerous activities, and defending against civil litigation including employment tribunal proceedings.",

    "title": "Using Body Worn Cameras",
    "content": "3.2 Using Body Worn Cameras where applicable Body worn cameras are likely to be more intrusive than CCTV systems because of their mobility. As such, the cameras should only be switched on when a Security Officer or colleague anticipates that an incident is about to take place and it should be switched off as soon as the incident is over and has been fully recorded. They must announce that they are going to activate their body worn camera. The Security Officer colleague must receive appropriate training before using the BWC. The body worn camera must be worn by the Security Officer colleague for the duration of their shift only while they are on the branch floor or while making a delivery. If the officer colleague goes into a colleague area (e.g., for a break), the body worn camera must be removed. Should a situation occur or escalate to the point that the security officer colleague feels vulnerable to aggression, they must announce that they are going to activate their body worn camera. The camera records both images and audio. The body worn camera only records once activated, although there is a pre-record function whereby the 60 seconds prior to activation are also captured in the event of the panic alarm being pressed. This is to ensure that there is full context around any recorded event. Images collected by the camera will not be used as a performance management tool or to capture ad hoc images, nor will they be used outside of the business premises except for authorised use for deliveries. BWC's must be returned at the end of the shift and placed onto the dock charger. BWC material should be retained in accordance with Section 10 of the CCTV Policy. Non-Booker BWC devices are not permitted. Any Security Officers colleagues found to have misused the BWC device must be reported to a manager as soon as possible and could face disciplinary action. If any BWC surveillance footage has been incorrectly shared, copied or recorded on another mobile device, this is deemed a potential data breach. If you suspect or identify that a data incident has occurred it is essential that it is reported immediately via the dedicated email dataprivacy@booker.co.uk. The team will review all data incidents reported and determine what action Booker should take to prevent or reduce the potential harm to our customers and colleagues; more information can be found under Privacy on the Our Booker policy hub.",

The inward facing vehicle cameras ( Lytx ) are designed to capture video footage and audio only where an Event has been detected ( e.g. , when activated by a G force trigger such as hard braking , sudden acceleration , swerving , excessive speed , or other potentially unsafe actions that could lead to a collision ) . Drivers can manually trigger the camera to record an Event if they think their safety and or security is at risk from other external factors . Lytx inward cameras must only be activated for the purposes of recording and preventing anti-social behaviour and crime incidents in front of the vehicle to protect the safety and security of customers and colleagues . The inward camera is always active but ONLY records a clip including audio when an event is triggered by a sudden G force action or a manual request is made by the driver to record . So for example , if triggered by an event , the system would save footage showing 8 seconds before the event and 4 seconds after . When an Event is triggered , the 12-second clip that has been saved is uploaded to Lytx centrally . A Lytx colleague would then review the footage . Some will be discarded ( e.g. , a false activation over a speed bump ) and these will never be sent to Booker . Remaining clips would be placed in an electronic coaching folder , and a nominated Booker Manager would have access to this . Booker would then use the information to speak to the driver either to say well done if an accident incident was avoided , or explain what the issue is if we think the driver could have handled things differently . The Lytx forward external facing camera records for 100 hours of vehicle use and then overwrites the data . The video can be requested from the camera via the online system requested footage is saved on the system for 90 days and then archived where the event is saved onto the Booker shared drive . It is kept in line with the relevant incident retention period .

Those colleagues and security officers who are authorised to view surveillance footage are strictly prohibited from sharing this footage with any other individual or posting it on social media. Any colleagues found to have done so must be reported and could face disciplinary action; refer to point 4.2 for more information. Images captured by any CCTV system must be monitored in a self-contained and secure area on the premises. Only designated colleagues trained in their duties shall have access to live footage. A list of these colleagues will be held by the Branch Area DC Manager. Non-essential access to the CCTV systems will be controlled by means of a keypad access lock or a password with access levels controlled and monitored by the Area Branch DC Manager. Access codes and or passwords should be changed regularly and in any case, if they are shared with another colleague for the purposes of an investigation into a serious occurrence, once this access is no longer required for this purpose. The codes should be stored securely with a hard copy of the master code kept in the safe and updated each time the code is changed. If CCTV monitoring stands are located in an open area (e.g., entrances), they should not be left unattended to prevent any other non-authorised individual from viewing live footage. If they are not in use or if the security officer is away (e.g., on break), the CCTV system monitor should be switched off and or locked. Where images can be viewed in plain sight, Branch Area DC Managers, Facilities Managers, Security Managers, Security Business Partners, and Security Officers should be mindful of colleagues and customers potentially taking pictures of the screen with their personal devices.

An incident could occur when the personal data we handle becomes lost, altered, or destroyed without authorisation or similarly we accidentally disclose or share personal data to individuals who are not authorised to see it. See Section 4 for examples of data incidents. The Data Protection Act defines Personal Data as data that relates to a living individual who can be identified directly from that data or indirectly or in combination with that data and other information which is in the possession of or is likely to come into possession of Booker. Personal data incidents may or may not be caused by data breaches. When we have a data breach of a serious nature involving personal data, we are under a legal obligation to notify the regulator and sometimes the individuals affected. We have a team dedicated to reviewing every data incident and determining what actions we need to take.

It is a way of working that can be adapted to suit your needs, enabling you to have the ability to manage both work and personal commitments more flexibly. There are many forms of flexible working, including part-time working, having a fixed shift pattern, working a set number of days a week, job sharing with a colleague, and working from home remotely some of the time. Many colleagues in the business already work flexibly; different shift patterns and business areas mean we can accommodate a variety of requests. The flexible working solution most appropriate for you will depend on the job you have, your location (i.e. office, store, or distribution centre), whether there are seasonal fluctuations in your workload, and if you\u2019re a manager, whether you\u2019ll be able to display a degree of flexibility with your flexible working arrangements.

An informal and temporary change may include requesting to work from home on an occasional basis, or starting work an hour earlier in order to finish an hour earlier for a couple of weeks in the summer while your child is on their school holiday.

A counselling letter is automatically loaded onto SAP when a colleague triggers for one; hence the email advising to move to first written warning. However, if the counselling letter wasn\u2019t issued by the branch when it should have been, we can\u2019t move forward with the formal absence process so should instead issue a counselling letter now and reply to the email advising the counselling was missed before but has now been issued.

It also involves managing and monitoring other absences within the company that may impact on the day to day smooth running of the business. Effective absence management can improve morale, motivation and culture, whilst aiding the reduction of costs in terms of time, resource, lost productivity and administration.

Where practical, the manager should be contacted before the start of the shift e.g. night shift, part time, afternoon shifts. Colleagues MUST phone in person. In circumstances where this is not possible they should arrange for a family member or friend to contact their manager. If the colleague leaves a message on voicemail, or with another colleague, their manager will call them back. A text message, or message by email or other social media e.g. Facebook, is not an acceptable form of contact. When the colleague calls, the manager will establish the reason for the absence when the illness began, whether they have visited the Doctor or sought medical advice and if so, the outcome, what support we can immediately provide, any work that needs to be handed over, an estimated return to work date.",

Left unchecked it can lead to increased blood pressure and heart problems. Eat regularly and sensibly; this will help increase your energy levels and reduce tiredness. Always have breakfast and take at least 30 minutes for lunch away from work. Consider going for a walk if possible to return refreshed and more productive. Ensure you get enough sleep; try to relax for an hour before going to bed to aid sleep. Do not drink coffee or alcohol directly before going to bed. Try to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol and tobacco; these can increase blood pressure, compounding the effects of stress making it difficult to relax.
