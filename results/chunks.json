The basic idea of learning models is divided into three categories. For a given problem, the collection of all possible outcomes represents the sample space or instance space\n \nUsing a Logical expression\n \nLogical models\n \nUsing the Geometry of the instance space\n \nGeometric models\n \nUsing Probability to classify the instance space\n \nProbabilistic models\n \nGrouping and Grading 1 3 1 Logical models Logical models use a logical expression to divide the instance space into segments and hence construct grouping models  A logical expression is an expression that returns a Boolean value  i e a True or False outcome  Once the data is grouped using a logical expression, the data is divided into homogeneous groupings for attempting to solve a problem.  For example, for a classification problem, all the instances in the group belong to one class.  There are mainly two kinds of logical models: Tree models and Rule models.  Rule models consist of a collection of implications or IF THEN rules.  For tree-based models, the  if part defines a segment and the  then part defines the behaviour of the model for this segment.  Rule models follow the same reasoning. Logical models and Concept learning. ",
