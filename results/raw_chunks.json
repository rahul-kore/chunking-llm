If you live within your region and have a normal place of work base office within your region  then travel to and from this location cannot be claimed for, as this is ordinary commute\n\n   For example, I live within my region, which is Region One. My normal place of work is Falkirk and I cannot claim my journeys to and from this store as it is my ordinary commute.  When I travel to other stores within my region, which are not a normal place of work, I can claim for these journeys. \n\n   If you live within your region and have a normal place of work somewhere outside of your region, then you will not be able to claim for this journey.  For example, I live within my region but attend a team meeting on a fortnightly basis in a set location outside of my region.  I can claim for this journey as this would be regarded as a temporary workplace.

I can claim all of my journeys to Booker locations or third parties as none of them have a set pattern or regularity and therefore are not my ordinary commute. \n\n   I am nationally based and once a week I work from the Northampton branch. This is a normal place of work for me and I cannot claim my journey as it is my ordinary commute.

When does a temporary workplace become a permanent workplace Where a temporary location becomes permanent, travel becomes ordinary commute \n\n   If you are working at a location for a period of continuous work which lasts or is likely to last more than 12 months then this would be classed as a permanent location. A period of continuous work is classed as a period of work where duties of the role are performed to a significant extent at a workplace.  \n\n   HMRC class a \u2018significant extent\u2019 at a workplace as 40% or more of your working time spent there. This means that where you have spent or are likely to spend 40% or more of your working time at a particular workplace over a period of 12 months, it will be classed as a permanent workplace. \n\n   For example, I work in Peterborough but I\u2019m also working on a project in Wellingborough DC on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays for 18 months.  Because I spend more than 40% of my working time at Wellingborough over a period of more than 12 months, Wellingborough is also a permanent workplace and I cannot claim for my journey as it is my ordinary commute"
