Non-Virtual Wallet limits are set automatically when the customer's debit/banking\n\u00ae\n\ncard is ordered based on the highest-feature account accessed with the card. For example, a customer uses the ATM, and their debit card accesses a Standard\naccount and a Performance account. The card limits will be that of the Performance account because it has higher features than the Standard account.\n\nLimits restrict dollar amount per day\n\nDaily limits restrict the total dollar amount of ATM, PIN POS and non-PIN POS transactions performed by a cardholder using a \n.\nsingle card each calendar day\n\nFor example, a card that's restricted to a $1,000 ATM withdrawal limit can be used to withdraw $1,000 each day. The limit applies whether the card is used in one\ntransaction of $1,000 or ten transactions of $100.",

The rows represent different transaction types, such as Business (inquiry only), Conference (inquiry only), and Visitor (which can be either an inquiry or not).\n\nThe values in the table indicate whether a particular transaction type is supported by a given system type. A value of \"1\" indicates that the transaction type is supported, while a value of \"11\" may indicate that it is not.\n\nBased on the table, it appears that all of the system types are capable of supporting Business (inquiry only), Conference (inquiry only), and Visitor (inquiry or not) transactions. However, there are some differences in the capabilities of the different system types when it comes to other transaction types.\n\nFor example, the ATM Hildyard system supports ATM depout transactions, while the PIN POS and Non-PPM POS systems do not. On the other hand, the PIN POS and Non-PPM POS systems support Non-PPM transactions, while the ATM Hildyard and ATM depout systems do not.\n\nOverall, this table provides a useful overview of the capabilities of different financial transaction systems with respect to various transaction types.
