    "content": "# # What Is Ordinary Commute ? Ordinary commute is your journey to and from your normal place of work . Your normal place of work is anywhere you go on a regular and permanent ( permanent being more than 12 months ) basis to carry out your normal work duties - this is defined by HMRC . In most circumstances , you can not claim any travel costs for your ordinary commute . This not only applies to fuel , but also to train , plane and bus fares . The commute is based on how often you visit the same location and annual leave is factored into this . You may visit differing people at the same location , or you may visit the same location regularly for only a couple of hours , in both scenario 's this would still be classed as an ordinary commute . It is your responsibility to ensure that you comply with the 'Commute rules ' when completing your normal mileage return . We will conduct regular audits to ensure that there are no unintended infringements . Managers are expected to review their teams mileage to ensure compliance . There is also a requirement for both the Manager and colleague to ensure that the correct normal commute locations are entered into SAP ."

    "content": "# # 1 . What Is Classed As A Permanent Workplace ? It is usually clear whether or not a location is your permanent workplace ( and , therefore , whether a journey to or from that place is ordinary commuting ) . A place is a permanent workplace if you attend it regularly to perform your duties of employment , and it is not a temporary workplace ( see Section 7 ) . You attend a workplace regularly if your attendance is : - Frequent ( At least once a week , it does not have to be the same day each week ) - For all or almost all of the period for which you hold or are likely to hold that employment It 's possible that you may have two or more normal workplaces depending on your working arrangements ."

    "content": "# # 3 . Roles With Two Or More Normal Workplaces , Dual Located Or Multi-Sited Roles If you have more than one normal place of work , travel to and from any of these locations is your ordinary commute and can not be claimed for or supplemented . I am based in the Equity office , but I travel to Eccles every Monday and Deeside every Wednesday . All three of these locations will be my normal place of work and I can not claim any of my * * journeys to or from them . * * I am based in the Watford office , but once a week I work from High Wycombe . I do n't work from High Wycombe * * on a set day * * each week , it can depend on which day is most suitable , High Wycombe is still a normal place of work and I can not claim for my journey to and from here as it is my ordinary commute . In my role I look after four different branches in my area . I visit all four of these branches once a week in order to perform my duties . Journeys to and from home to these sites can not be claimed for or supplemented , however my travel in * * between * * these * * sites can be claimed for . E.g . I look after Avonmouth , Bristol , Bath and Trowbridge branches . I can not claim for my * * travel to and from these branches * * to home , but when I travel to Avonmouth and then on to Bristol in the same day , I can * * claim for my journey between Avonmouth and Bristol , but not from Bristol to home . A normal place of work does n't just apply to our offices or branches , it can also apply to suppliers , if you visit a certain supplier on a regular and permanent basis . I work in Quality Control and as part of my role I visit one of our suppliers every Friday in order to carry out the duties of my role . I have visited this supplier on Fridays for the past 18 months . As I visit this location on a regular and * * permanent * * basis it is a normal place of work , therefore my journey to and from here is an ordinary commute and can not be * * claimed * * for . If you have one or more normal place ( s ) of work and travel to a different location for a temporary business purpose and a limited duration , travel from home to the different location can be claimed for . Being cost conscious , we do n't expect you to claim if your journey is shorter than your ordinary commute and/or it costs less . Effectively you are already saving money on your journey . I am based in the Wellingborough DC , but I attend a training day at the Northampton * * branch . I can claim all of my journey * * to and from home and the Northampton branch , as this is longer than my normal commute to Wellingborough . When I attended a training day at Kettering , this journey was much shorter than my normal commute to * * Wellingborough , therefore * * I did n't claim for the * * journey . * * I am based in Hatfield DC and I need to attend a meeting in Equity . I have only been to the Equity offices once before , * * therefore * * it is not my normal place of work . I can claim my travel , train fare or bus fare to and from the Equity * * office . * *"

You Live Outside Your Region If you live outside of your region and are travelling into your region to visit a third party or Booker location , we have agreed with HMRC that you can not claim for any travel from your home to the nearest Booker site within your region and this particular journey will be deemed as your ordinary commute . When you travel to another location within your region , you must deduct this ordinary commute from the mileage you are claiming .

I travel from home to a different branch in my region , which is 118 miles away . I can not claim for the first 26 miles , meaning my claim would be 92 miles ( 118-26 = 92 ) . I would make the same deduction when travelling home . If you live outside your region and visit a location outside of your region on a regular and permanent basis to perform your work duties , then you will not be able to claim for this journey . My region is Region 3 , but every Monday I attend a team meeting in Equity for four hours .

    "content": "# # 7 . When Does A Temporary Workplace Become A Permanent Workplace ? Where a temporary location becomes permanent , travel becomes ordinary commute . If you are working at a location for a period of continuous work which lasts , or is likely to last , more than 12 months then this would be classed as a permanent location . A period of continuous work is classed as a period of work where duties of the role are performed to a significant extent at a workplace . HMRC class a 'significant extent ' at a workplace as 40 % or more of your working time spent there . This means that where you have spent or are likely to spend 40 % or more of your working time at a particular workplace over a period of 12 months , it will be classed as a permanent workplace . I work in Peterborough but I 'm also working on a project in Wellingborough DC on Wednesdays , Thursdays , and Fridays for 18 months . Because I spend more than 40 % of my working time at Wellingborough * * over a period of more than 12 months , * * Wellingborough is also a permanent workplace and I can not claim for my journey as it is my ordinary * * commute . * * However , secondments are an exception to this . Your secondment duration can last up to 24 months before being classed as a normal commute . The location will cease to be a temporary workplace from the date the expectation of the length of secondment changes . I am currently on secondment from Chester branch to Liverpool branch * * and have been for 17 months of an 18 month * * secondment . I have been claiming for my journey from home to the Liverpool branch . Yesterday I was told that my secondment would be extended by a further 10 months . From this point onwards I can no longer claim my journey to Liverpool as the secondment * * will last for more than 24 months and therefore is classed as a permanent place of work . * *"
